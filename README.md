# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Brain Tumor Image available on Kaggle was used for data fetching purpose with implementation of image pre-processing techniques such as Thresholding ,median filtering,morphological operations,smoothening performed to get good preprocessed image that can be used for machine learning or deep learning.Though,learning is not the concern here,the future scope of the project could be applying deep learning models such as convolutional neural network which can classify different variations of the unseen images into 1(has brain tumor) and 0(no brain tumor).
